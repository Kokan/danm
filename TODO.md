# TODO

This is a preparation document for the discussion about DANM.


What could be done:
* Travis integration
  * Compile
  * Unit tests
  * Functional test (not presetn yet)
  * Optional: style check, copyright check, coverage, any other metric
* Easy setup/integration
  * Dockerhub images (dockerhub gives the infrastructure)
  * RBAC (less examples)
  * Set up guide that assumes the user could start kubernetes, and does not want to compile/code
* Contribution
  * Some drawing about architecture would be nice
  * Otherwise looks good to me
